[Fevol](https://github.com/Fevol) has a great GitHub Gist on debugging and profiling plugin code.

There is also [this article](https://alan.norbauer.com/articles/browser-debugging-tricks) that [Fevol](https://github.com/Fevol) found on debugging tips and tricks.

The Gist can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/Fevol/b672865d61e54ac6f61e7c88aa05ba42) as well as after this paragraph.

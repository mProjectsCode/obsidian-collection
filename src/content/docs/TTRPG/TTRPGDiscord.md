There are two places on Discord where you can talk about TTRPGs and Obsidian.

Firstly the [Obsidian Discord](https://discord.com/channels/686053708261228577/916477002909876265) has a channel called `#tabletop-games` where you can talk about TTRPGs in general and Obsidian in the context of TTRPGs.

Secondly there is the [TTRPG Discord](https://discord.gg/kZY7JPN6nf) which is a Discord server dedicated to TTRPGs and Obsidian.

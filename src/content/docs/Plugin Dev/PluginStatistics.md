title: Plugin Statistics
description: View statistics on the plugin ecosystem on Obsidian Stats.

I maintain another website called [Obsidian Stats](https://www.moritzjung.dev/obsidian-stats/) which accumulates some [useful statistics on the plugin ecosystem](https://www.moritzjung.dev/obsidian-stats/pluginstats/repodata/).

For example, at the time of writing this, only about 16% of plugins use testing frameworks and for Obsidian plugins, Svelte is almost as popular as React.
